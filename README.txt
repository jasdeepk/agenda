HI

go to a page; 
1/2 screen schedule -> schedule other side(left) text box -> pick date -> type what to do [type {meeting, etc}]

THINGS TO DO:

valid date: start time < end time
sql fixing for start time || end time
sort events
search events
make start / end time nicer
delete events (a button)


later: 
users
(delete older / past events in time)
email user when event is coming up (important ones)
output display calendar
